INTERDIACRITICAL KEYBOARD LAYOUT

The keyboard layout with simple and intuitive input method of every single diacritical letter — dedicated for typographers, linguists or editors working with multiple languages.


THE PROBLEM

With multiple languages at work, input of diacritical letters by keyboard happens to be quite problematic. Dozens of quirky key combinations to access foreign diacritics through a language's native keyboard, still giving not even a fraction of world's diacritical variety. Or switching from language to language for specific input, each defined without single, predictable manner.

Frustration over this mess to deal with gave an idea of a layout with a single, ridiculously intuitive method ever required for possibly all existing diacritical letters. The keyboard layout that is simple and clear, with key's engraved labels being, in fact, always the actual input. Keyboard that is suitable for touch-typists used to type with uninterrupted flow, what the method inherently allows.


THE METHOD

The method is simply the Option key + the base letter, followed by typing diacritic's name. Therefore pressing, say, Opt + e, followed by typing »acute« spits an é. There's also no need to type the entire name, since the keyboard estimates it and suggests early available output.


FEATURED DIACRITICS

Supported diacritics, to be typed in the literal form, are: acute, breve, caron (also as hacek), circumflex, diaeresis (umlaut), dot, grave, macron, ogonek, ring, stroke, tilde and — with the method extensible by nature — possibly more in the future.


INSTALLATION

The layout is installed simply by copying the .keylayout file into the Keyboard Layouts folder within the system's /Library or user's ~/Library (on older Mac OS X re-log recommended). Enable it via the Input tab of the Language & Text (formerly International) system preferences. To preview layout's mechanics just see the Keyboard Viewer from the Input Source status bar item.
